            Sarah, an executive at Pharma Co., is in charge of a drug called
            Luminarex, an immunotherapy which has not yet been approved by the
            FDA. Sarah's drug is currently in phase 3 of Clinical Trials,
            specifically targeting a disease called Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
            (NSCLC), and Sarah hopes that her drug will be approved soon.
